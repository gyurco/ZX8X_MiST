# ZX80/ZX81 for [MIST](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-board/wiki) and other compatible FPGA boards

### Features:
- Based on Grant Searle's [ZX80 page](http://searle.x10host.com/zx80/zx80.html)
- Selectable ZX80/ZX81
- 16k/32k/64k RAM packs
- CHR128 board at $2000-$3FFF (8 banks)
- Quicksilva character board at $8400
- YM2149 sound chip (ZON X-81 compatible)
- Sinclar type joystick (keys 67890)
- PAL/NTSC timings
- Turbo loading of .o and .p files
- Loading original tapes from the UART RX or TAPE IN port
- Support of Chroma 81 color interface

### Tape loading
Selecting an .o (ZX80) or .p (ZX81) file opens the tape. This is indicated by the
user LED. The LOAD "" command will load it as it would be on a standard tape.
If there's no opened file, the standard ROM load routine is executed, and it
can receive tape data from the UART/AUDIO IN port.

Reset (ALT-F11 or the Reset OSD option) closes the .o or .p file.

### CHR and COL file support
Loading of CHR (character definition) and COL (color defininiton) files are possible
if the firmware has XML support compiled in. For the CHR support, Quicksilva character
board must be enabled, for COL support, the Chroma 81 interface must be 'on'.

### Download precompiled binaries and system ROMs:
For MiST, go to [releases](https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-binaries/tree/master/cores/zx01) folder. Copy the rbf
and zx8x.rom file to the root of the SD card.

For other boards, look at their respective release distributions.
